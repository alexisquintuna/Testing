# Testing
Basic project to get an understanding on how to test react apps with the testing built in feature

## Getting Started

To be able to run this code go to the specific folder the code is in via `cd` command in terminal or command prompt.

Afterwards run `npm install` to install all required dependencies(this will create the `/node_module` folder).

(Be sure you're using node version 16 when running the code `nvm install 16`.)

After instaliing the requirements to start the application run `npm test` and then `a` to run all tests.
